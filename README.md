CityConnecter
===========

This is an experimental AI for [OpenTTD](http://www.openttd.org). The purpose of this AI is to build roads between the cities. It starts as a company, and since it is building roads without competing, it goes bancrupt from time to time.

Any updates to this AI is posted on the [TT-Forum](http://www.tt-forums.net/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=70063)
